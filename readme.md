python2.7.9 running on ubuntu:18.04

This specific version of Python is the minimum requirement for running the [awsprocesscreds](https://github.com/awslabs/awsprocesscreds) tool.

Note: timezone is hard-coded to `America/New_York` at the Ubuntu layer to prevent the awscli tool from prompting for timezone when it is auto-installed.
